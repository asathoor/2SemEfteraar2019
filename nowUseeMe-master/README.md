## What is a webdocumentary?
From the perspective of the designer og communicator a webdocumentary is a visual genre related to storytelling, e.g. in online journalism. From the perspective of the web developer a webdocumentary is just a long html document enhanced by the usual suspects: JavaScript and CSS. Basicly a webdocumentary behaves in the same way as the scrolls from ancient cultures. The Egyptian "Book of the Dead" and the Hebrew "Tora" are samples of a the storytelling tradition that precedes the modern books.

But the web scroll can do thing, that was not possible in the scrolls of antiquity. By JavaScript and CSS the webdocumentary comes to life. You can detect where the mouse is, if the arrow hover a certain element, clicks and even if some element is visible or not. Events are the keys to the art.

So the webdocumentary is a way to tell a story by by means of human interactions with your scroll.
